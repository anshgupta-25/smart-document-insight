## 🚨 The Problem

AI is **broken** — and nobody talks about it.

### Why Should You Care?

| Problem | Impact |
|:---|:---|
| 🧠 **AI Hallucinations** | Large Language Models generate confident, plausible-sounding answers — that are completely fabricated. No source. No proof. No accountability. |
| 🔍 **Broken Retrieval** | Standard RAG systems retrieve chunks of text and hope for the best. No verification. No integrity check. Garbage in, hallucination out. |
| 📦 **Lossy Compression** | When documents are compressed for AI context windows, critical details vanish — names, dates, amounts, legal clauses — gone without a trace. |
| ⚖️ **Real-World Risk** | In **legal**, **medical**, **financial**, and **compliance** domains, a single hallucinated answer can cost millions, destroy trust, or endanger lives. |

**The industry treats retrieval as a solved problem. It isn't.**

Traditional systems give you *an answer*. GhostCut gives you **a verified answer with proof.**

## 💡 Our Solution

GhostCut is not another chatbot. It's a **trust engine** for AI-powered document intelligence.

<div align="center">

```
  📄 Document In → 🔪 Smart Compression → 🔍 Verified Retrieval → ✅ Proven Answer Out
```

</div>

### 🔬 Five Pillars of Trusted Intelligence

| Pillar | What It Does |
|:---|:---|
| 🛡️ **Retrieval Integrity Auditor** | Every retrieved chunk is audited for relevance, accuracy, and source fidelity. Nothing slips through unverified. |
| 📦 **Contextual Compression Engine** | 3-level hierarchical compression preserves critical facts, entities, and relationships — not just keywords. |
| ✅ **Verification System** | Post-retrieval word-match and semantic validation with status badges: ✅ Verified, ⚠️ Unverified, ❌ Conflict. |
| 🔗 **Evidence Tracking** | Every answer links back to **exact Page → Line → Chunk** in the source document. Clickable. Auditable. Trustworthy. |
| 👻 **Ghost Mode** | AI-powered gap analysis that reveals what your document *can't* answer — before you make a bad decision. |
